    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      We are a team of students in the Computer Science department at the University of Hawaii.
      Organized and captained by JR Lee, the team members include Jared Seto, Shaelyn Loo, and
      Kevin Clarkin. Sharing a class called ICS 314, we named ourselves ICS 3+1=4, since there
      were 3 of us, we added 1 more, and we are Section 4. Only after countless hours (and some
      head banging one the table) did we finally arrive at (the much catchier) Aloha Archives,
      thanks to a moment of inspiration by Shaelyn. We have carried the name with us ever since.
